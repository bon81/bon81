## 👋 Hi, I'm Bonnie!

I'm a Data Engineer with a background in psychology and a growing passion for data security. I recently completed the Northcoders Data Engineering bootcamp, where I built cloud-native pipelines, transformed messy datasets, and developed a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and AWS. I’m particularly interested in building robust ETL systems that not only move data efficiently but do so with security in mind.
