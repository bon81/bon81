## 👋 Hi, i'm Bonnie!

I’m a Junior Data Engineer with a background in forensic psychology, mental health, and criminal justice. After completing the Northcoders Data Engineering boot camp, I’ve been diving into the world of data analytics and cybersecurity—two fields where I can blend technical problem-solving with real-world impact.

From statistical analysis in R to building data pipelines in AWS, I enjoy working with data to uncover insights and drive meaningful change. I’m especially interested in cybersecurity, data analysis, and risk assessment, and I’m currently working on projects that bridge these areas.
