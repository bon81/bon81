## 👋 Hi, I'm Bonnie!

🔍  I’m a Junior Analyst | Aspiring Cyber Security Professional with a background in forensic psychology, mental health, and criminal justice. After completing the Northcoders Data Engineering boot camp, I’ve been diving into the world of data analytics and cybersecurity—two fields where I can blend technical problem-solving with real-world impact.

📊  From statistical analysis in R to building data pipelines in AWS, I enjoy working with data to uncover insights and drive meaningful change. I’m especially interested in cybersecurity, data analysis, and risk assessment. I’m currently working on projects that bridge these areas.
